# DZRT - Premium Nicotine Pouches E-Commerce

## Overview

DZRT is an Arabic-first e-commerce platform for premium nicotine pouches. The application features a modern dark-themed design with RTL (right-to-left) support, product catalog, shopping cart functionality, and checkout flow. Built as a full-stack TypeScript application with React frontend and Express backend.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state, React Context for cart state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming, dark mode by default
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library (New York style) with Radix UI primitives
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for page transitions and micro-interactions
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js running on Node.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ESM modules
- **API Design**: RESTful JSON API with `/api` prefix
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Schema Validation**: Zod schemas generated from Drizzle schema using drizzle-zod

### Data Storage
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Schema Location**: `shared/schema.ts` contains all database table definitions
- **Migrations**: Managed via `drizzle-kit push` command
- **Tables**: users, products, orders, orderItems

```

### Build System
- **Development**: Vite dev server for frontend with HMR, tsx for backend
- **Production**: Custom build script using esbuild for server bundling, Vite for client
- **Output**: Combined into `dist/` directory with static files in `dist/public`

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Monorepo Structure**: Client and server share types via `shared/` directory, eliminating type duplication
2. **RTL-First Design**: HTML set to `dir="rtl"` with Arabic as primary language, using Cairo and Tajawal fonts
3. **Dark Theme Default**: Application uses dark mode by default with green primary accent color
4. **Cart Persistence**: Shopping cart stored in localStorage for session persistence
5. **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Zod validation ensuring runtime type safety
6. **Firebase Integration**: Firestore used for real-time order tracking and admin approval workflow
7. **Security-First Checkout**: No sensitive payment data stored - only cardLast4 and boolean verification flags

## Pages

- **Home** (`/`): Landing page with hero, product grid, and promotional content
- **Products** (`/products`): Product catalog with filtering
- **Checkout** (`/checkout`): Multi-step checkout with Firestore-controlled approval gates
- **Support** (`/support`): Customer support center with contact info, FAQ, and contact form
- **About** (`/about`): Company information, stats, and mission statement

## Checkout Flow & Firestore Approval System

The checkout uses a Firestore-controlled approval workflow:
1. User enters card info → saved to Firestore (only cardLast4)
2. Card OTP verification → user enters code, waits for admin approval (`cardOtpApproved`)
3. Card PIN verification → user enters PIN, waits for admin approval (`cardPinApproved`)
4. Phone verification → user confirms number and provider
5. Phone OTP → user enters code, waits for admin approval (`phoneOtpApproved`)
6. Nafath verification → user enters national ID, waits for admin approval (`nafathApproved`)
7. Nafath auth dialog → final authentication modal
8. Success → order confirmed

**Real-time Listeners**: Uses Firestore `onSnapshot` to monitor approval status changes and automatically proceed when admin approves each step.
